# 📘 Why I Chose Aesop’s Fables as the Document

I selected **Aesop’s Fables** because it strikes a perfect balance between simplicity, depth, and user engagement. This timeless collection of short stories offers rich moral lessons and diverse characters, making it ideal for showcasing how a chatbot can:

- Understand and retrieve information from multiple stories
- Provide accurate answers to story-based questions
- Summarize stories on demand with proper context
- Explain stories in a simple and relatable way (like “Explain Like I’m 5”)
- Offer spoken responses through text-to-speech

Its structure allowed me to test chunking, embeddings, and retrieval techniques while keeping the interaction enjoyable and educational.
